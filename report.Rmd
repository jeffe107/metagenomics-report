# Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>**Background**
Rice is one of the top three crops that contribute 60% of the calories consumed by humans worldwide. Nonetheless, extensive rice harvesting yields more than 700 tons of rice straw, a byproduct that is often difficult for farmers to manage efficiently. As a result, millions of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases are released, causing issues such as respiratory problems, soil degradation and global warming. In this work, we explore the biological decomposition of rice straw through the application of microbial consortia from a metagenomics perspective.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>**Results**
We applied different treatments to rice straw placed in a mulching setup at field scale, using various combinations of a Trichoderma-based commercial product, the bacterial strain Bacillus altitudinis, organic nitrogen, and a mixture of organic carbon and acids. After 30 days, we characterized the microbiome community on the surface of the material and from the soil by reconstructing and functionally annotating Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs), and comparing it with the initial microbial composition. The metagenomics data analysis allowed for the recovery of high-quality MAGs that exhibit the potential to decompose rice straw, as they possess the enzymatic machinery to metabolize the main components of the plant cell wall. Additionally, in soil samples, the MAGs with the highest potential to utilize lignocellulosic residues as carbon are grouped together under the phyla Actinomycetota and Acidobacteriota. Moreover, these experiments revealed an increase in β-glucosidase activity following treatment application, along with an improvement in the total carbon quantified in the soil; however, interestingly, in some cases, although the presence of genes related to β-glucosidase synthesis was established, no experimental activity was quantified.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>**Conclusions**
This contribution underscores the applicability of different biological strategies to convert rice straw into a more assimilable substrate. The abundance of MAGs detected with the ability to decompose rice straw indicates that the proposed treatments may trigger their activation and subsequent activity. The fact that high-quality MAGs account for the potential to metabolize rice straw, yet no experimental degradation was detected, highlights the need for further study of expression patterns in this context.<p style='text-align: justify;'>

# Methodology

## Taxonomic profiling

<p style='text-align: justify;'>We used Kraken2/Bracken to perform taxonomic assignment of the reads. The procedure included the remotion of reads mapping the rice genome ([O. zativa, Build_4.0](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml)). The workflow is proposed by Lu et al. (2022) as follows (wrapped by Nextflow):</p>

![](images/workflow.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The analysis of the raw counts was developed by wrapping the output as a Phyloseq object to estimate effect of treatments and time over relative abundance, α-Diversity, β-Diversity and differentially abundant taxa.</p>

## Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) recovery

<p style='text-align: justify;'>nf-core/mag was implemented to build and annotate the MAGs from the raw sequences. A co-assembly/co-binning strategy was chosen as an attempt to improve the quality and resolution of the MAGs. MEGAHIT was used for the assembly, while MaxBin2 and MetaBAT2 were the selected tools for binning. A de-replication and refinement step was carried by enabling DASTool within the workflow. For the downstream analysis, the curated MAGs were analyzed with MAGFlow/BIgMAG, that includes quality-measuring tools such as CheckM2, BUSCO, GUNC and QUAST, as well as the taxonomic annotator GTDB-Tk2 relying on the database version R220. The presence of carbohydrate-related metabolism enzymes was studied through dbCAN3 along with the [CAZy](https://dbcan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) database, whilst Cluster of Orthologous Genes (COGs) were detected by COGclassifier. The selection of the MAGs was carried out using the criteria: completeness above 50% and contamination below 10%. In addition, MAGS belonging to either rice straw or soil with average differences <5% ANI were clustered using FastANI. For data visualization, Circos, iTOL and ggplot2 packages were used.</p>

# Results Taxonomic Profiling

## Relative abundance, α-Diversity and β-Diversity

> **Figure 1.** Taxonomic profiling of the sequences using Kraken2 coupled to Bracken: **a** Relative domain abundance per matrix source, merging all the replicates per sample. **b** α-Diversity, colored by Treatment, measured through Shannon and Inversed-Simpson indices. **c** Sample ordination through Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix as input. The ellipses represent 95% confidence regions around the centroids of each group calculated by the assumption of multivariate t-distribution. **d** Two-dimensional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding of β-Diversity estimation of the samples based on the Aitchison distance. **e** Compositional variability of the samples, measured as distance to the centroid in a multivariate space computed with the Aitchison distance among samples. ANOVA analysis results show no significant differences in terms of group dispersion. **f** Proportion of the variance explained by the factors Time and Treatment, segmented by matrix source, in Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) implemented according to different distance/dissimilarity metrics. The significance of the each factor is determined by the symbol color. All the analysis from **b** to **f** were carried out only with Bacteria data and with normalized raw counts as Counts per million (CPM). The Treatment colors are transversal to plots **b**, **d**, **e** and **f**.

The displayed abundance is part only of the portion of the reads belonging to each **domain** ( _see_ **Figure 1a** and **Figure S1**). Replicates were merged, and the panels are divided by matrix source. On phylum plots, only phyla with relative abundance above 0.5% are displayed, whilst on genus plots genera above 3% and 2% are depicted for _Bacteria_ and _Eukaryota_, respectively.

## Differentially abundant taxa

Right: Log2FC of Treatments to Control. Left: Boxplots of selected genera abundance (counts) in log10 scale. All displayed genera exhibit p-value < 0.05 adjusted with Holm–Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons. _Cont0_ and _Cont1_ in rice straw comparisons indicate Control samples at _Time_ 0 and 1, respectively. As a result, rice straw results depict differences throughout time for all treatments including Control. In the case of soil samples, Time 0 and Time 1 were merged for each Treatment since Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) results does not show significant differences for this factor. ANCOM-BC2 was implemented only with Bacteria data, agglomerated at genus level and taxa abundant in at least 0.5% and 0.05% (any sample) for rice straw and soil samples, respectively.

Presence/absence of MAGs annotated with GTDB-Tk2 in **rice straw** (**b**) **soil** (**d**) samples at **genus** level. Genome size, in Mbp, is indicated as the point size, while the color scale represents the relative abundance of each MAG per sample, and the point shape shows whether the displayed MAG is classified as high-quality or mid-quality (CheckM2). When MAGs with the same genus annotation were found in the same sample, the most complete one is depicted and their abundances are added up.

Visualization includes (from left to right): MAG clustering using the CAZy counts of the selected families, _Treatment_ origin of the MAG, phylum information (GTDB-Tk2), _Time_ (0: initial, 1: after 30 days of Treatment). The classification as mid-quality or high-quality MAG (CheckM2) is represented by the shape in the bubble plot. The displayed MAGs are representatives from the generated clusters using ANI, and they were selected based on the following score: completeness – 0.5 x contamination. Additionally, for **rice straw**, MAGs were filtered considering only the ones with at least 3000 normalized counts in 5 or more CAZy families; complete information about normalized counts of these MAGs is found in **figure S4**.
